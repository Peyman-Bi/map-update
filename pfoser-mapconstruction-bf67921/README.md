# Map Construction Algorithms
Enabled by the ubiquitous generation of geo-referenced tracking data, there has been a recent surge of algorithms that construct street maps from tracking data.

However, visual inspection is still the most common approach to evaluate the quality of the algorithms, and cross-comparison of different algorithms is very rare, since algorithms and constructed maps are generally not publicly available. There is a lack of benchmark data, and quantitative evaluation with suitable distance measures has just recently begun.

This repository will provide access to

* a set of map generation algorithms,
* data sets including tracking data as well as respective map datasets, and
* various distance measures to assess the quality of the constructed maps.

As they become available, we encourage interested scientists and developers to add their source code to this site.
